For the Github commit log see here: github.com/jks-prv/kiwiclient/commits/master

v1.9  January 3, 2025
    Added --rev-txt, --rev-bin and --rev-oob options to establish reverse connections back to Kiwi
    while streaming in netcat mode. Can also be used while in camp mode.
    
    These changes are necessary to support new Kiwi extensions under development.
    For example, to support a complex digital decoder that has to run on the kiwisdr.com servers
    (due to performance reasons similarly to how TDoA works). --nc and --camp-chan can be used to
    forward a received digital signal from a Kiwi channel to the remote decoder and --rev-bin to
    stream the decoded audio back to the Kiwi. --rev-oob can return any out-of-band text data
    decoded from the signal.
    
    Added option --camp-allow-1ch which allows camped output to remain in single channel (mono) mode
    if that is the current state of the camped channel. Normally camped output is always kept as
    2-channels (stereo) because you can't predict if the camped channel will arbitrarily switch
    between mono and stereo modes (e.g. AM and SAS or IQ).
    
    Github issue #158 fix from mghue (thanks!)

v1.8  December 20, 2025
    Added HTTP redirection support to handle the kiwisdr.com secondary proxy server.
    
    Added support for stored database DX label editing: list, add, delete (requested by DL5NEN)
    See the Makefile dx-list, dx-add, dx-del targets for usage examples.
    
    Fix from jmfriedt (thanks!) "Handle incomplete data segment #156"
    
    Removed kiwi_nc.py as it is now fully deprecated. Use the --nc option with kiwirecorder.
    See the "nc" targets in the Makefile.
    
    Initial work allowing netcat mode to send data in the reverse direction (back to the Kiwi).

v1.7  August 20, 2025
    Incorporated standard-chunk source code to eliminate all the problems with Python 13 and
        Debian 13 not being able to find and include the correct package.

    Most .py files: fix/add "#!/usr/bin/env python3" (thanks Rob)

v1.6  July 11, 2025
    By request: The resampling option now works with netcat and camping modes.

v1.5  June 15, 2025
    Added continuous frequency scanning capability.
        Kiwirecorder previously had a squelch-based scanning function using parameters specified
        with a YAML file and the --scan-yaml option. A set of frequencies would be scanned and the
        scanning stopped when the squelch opened. Continuous scanning will now occur if the
        "threshold" parameter is not given in the YAML file. See the file SCANNING for complete info.
        
        Note that the former example file scan.yaml has been renamed to scan_squelch.yaml to
        distinguish it from the new example file scan_continuous.yaml used in frequency scanning.
    
    Added Kiwi channel camping feature.
        Instead of creating a new connection to the Kiwi when kiwirecorder is run it can now "camp"
        onto an existing connection and record whatever audio the camped user is listening to.
        Very similar to the camp capability that is presented via the camp/queue panel that appears
        when you try and connect to a Kiwi when all its channels are full. See the option
        --camp=CAMP_CHAN where CAMP_CHAN is the channel number to camp on (e.g. 0..4 for rx0..rx4).

        Note that a 2-channel (stereo) file or netcat stream is always produced because you can't
        predict what the camped user will do. They may switch from a mono mode (e.g. USB) to a
        stereo mode (e.g. IQ) at any time. For mono modes the single channel audio is duplicated in
        both channels. Things also work when the camped user switches compression mode on and off.

        Camp mode also works with the --netcat option. For an example see the Makefile "camp" target.
        Note that camping does not currently support squelch or GPS timestamps.

    Netcat function:
        Made all the audio modes work correctly: mono/stereo, compression/no-compression.
        Note that netcat does not currently support squelch or GPS timestamps.
    
    Squelch function:
        Made tail timing correct for the various audio modes: mono/stereo, compression/no-compression.
